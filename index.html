<p>Cartoon Network (often abbreviated as CN) is an American cable television channel owned by the Warner Bros. Discovery Networks subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery.</p>
<p>Founded by Ted Turner (who appointed Betty Cohen as the first president of the network),[1] the channel was launched on October 1, 1992, and primarily broadcasts animated television series, mostly children's programming, ranging from action to animated comedy. It currently operates from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET/PT on weekdays, 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET/PT on Saturdays and from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. ET/PT on Sundays. Cartoon Network primarily targets children 6-14, while its early morning Cartoonito block is aimed at preschoolers and kindergarteners aged 2-6,[2] and its overnight daypart block Adult Swim targets older teenagers and young adults, 18-34 (the latter is treated as a separate entity for promotional purposes and as a separate channel by Nielsen for ratings purposes).</p>
